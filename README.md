# Diagnosing and Locating Abnormalities in Chest X-Rays using Deep Learning

This repository contains some of the notebooks and the report document of our team's research project for Machine Learning Practical course at The University of Edinburgh. 
We use deep learning to identify and detect locations of health abnormalities within chest X-Ray images. 
Research within this area can significantly improve accuracy in detecting health conditions from X-Ray scans, take off some burden of manual labour from radiologists and increase access of health services in underdeveloped regions.
