# Diagnosing and Locating Abnormalities in Chest X-Rays using Deep Learning

This repository contains some of the notebooks and the [final report](https://github.com/viliuskaulinskas/MLP-Project/blob/main/Project%20Report.pdf) of our team's research project for Machine Learning Practical course at The University of Edinburgh. 

We use deep learning to identify and detect locations of health abnormalities within chest X-Ray images. 

Research within this area can significantly improve accuracy in detecting health conditions from X-Ray scans, take off some burden of manual labour from radiologists and increase access of health services in underdeveloped regions.
